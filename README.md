# Video game

*06/10/2020 is the recent updates to the codebase.*

#### Simple game that displays score and lives 
-----
To code and modify this game I used my skills in JavaScript.

I had a sample of this game and task to make some changes in code according to it:

Used a different sprite for the player â€” there's a mikethefrog.png graphic you can use. It's 32 pixels tall and each frame is 32 pixel wide.
Added a life counter. The game start with 3 lives. Each time the player hits a bottle of poision they lose one life; at 0 lives the game is over.

Here you'll see how I modifed:

* Variables that store the values;
* Control structures show what happens and when happens;
* A functions which define specific steps a computer should take.

Also here you'll will see that I used:

* Phaser.JS library;

My improving plan for this project is:

1. To stop the action on the screen when the game is over or the player won.
2. To add the timer for the game.
